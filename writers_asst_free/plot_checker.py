    Please carefully analyze the following story for **significant** plot holes, major logical inconsistencies, critical continuity errors, or clearly unresolved character arcs/motivations that undermine the core narrative.

    Minor stylistic choices or interpretations are less critical unless they create genuine confusion. Acknowledge if the story is generally consistent but point out areas that *could* be strengthened for clarity or impact.

    For each significant issue found:
    1. Clearly identify the problem (e.g., "Major Plot Hole: Character X couldn't have known Y at this point based on previous events.").
    2. Explain *why* it's a significant issue for the story's coherence.
    3. Suggest specific corrections or ways to rewrite the problematic sections to resolve the issue. If possible, provide the corrected text directly.

    Story to analyze:
    ---
    {user_story}
    ---

    Provide a comprehensive analysis. If no major issues are found, state that clearly, perhaps offering minor suggestions for polish if appropriate.

# Note: The follow-up loop logic will be handled within the Streamlit app's structure

# --- Similar modifications needed for other modules ---
# story_generator.py, creative_explorer.py, style_transformer.py
# They should be refactored to:
# 1. Accept necessary inputs (like prompts, story text) as function arguments.
# 2. Return the LLM's response string.
# 3. Remove input() calls and direct print() statements meant for CLI display.
# 4. Keep print() for logging/debugging if desired.
# We'll do this refactoring directly within the Streamlit app file for simplicity.
