    Based on the core themes, plot elements, genre, tone, and overall feeling evoked by this text, please suggest:

    1.  **Books (3-5 suggestions):** List relevant books that explore similar ideas, share plot structures, or have a comparable style/tone. For each book, provide:
        *   Title and Author.
        *   A brief (1-2 sentences) explanation of *why* it's a relevant suggestion (e.g., "similar dystopian theme focusing on rebellion," "features a complex anti-hero protagonist like the one described," "shares the melancholic, reflective tone").

    2.  **Movies (3-5 suggestions):** List relevant movies that explore similar ideas, belong to a similar genre, or have a comparable visual style or atmosphere. For each movie, provide:
        *   Title and Director (if commonly known).
        *   A brief (1-2 sentences) explanation of *why* it's a relevant suggestion (e.g., "similar sci-fi mystery plot involving memory loss," "visual style matches the described dark fantasy setting," "deals with the theme of found family in a post-apocalyptic world").

    Format the response clearly with distinct sections for Books and Movies. Provide well-known examples where possible, but also consider less common works if they are a strong match. Focus on providing helpful inspiration for a writer exploring these themes/ideas.
