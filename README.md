Writers Asst is an AI-powered creative suite built on advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to assist writers from idea to narration. It uses large language models for story creation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for smart plot analysis and feedback, and vector embeddings for alternative plots, semantic recommendations, and clustering. Stories can be converted to audio using gTTS, while an interactive Streamlit interface enables real-time branch visualization. Other tools include style and tone transformation, grammar and coherence checks, multilingual generation, and voice input via the Web Speech API.

The Free version includes all core tools—story generation, exploration, feedback, and audio playback—while the Premium version enhances the experience with deeper analysis, expanded retrieval, advanced embeddings, and additional creative capabilities.
